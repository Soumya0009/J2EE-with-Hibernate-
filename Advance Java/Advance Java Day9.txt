Step 1 (Load and register the driver)
-------------------------------------
-> We have to download JAR file provided by the database vender inorder to connect our java application to the database.
-> If we use IDE then we have to configure JAR file inside 'java buil path' of the application.
-> If we dont use IDE, then we have to configure our JAR file inside 'class path enviroment variable'.
-> Sun micro system has provided 'java.sql.driver interface', it is database vender responsibility to provide implimentation class for driver interface inside JAR file.
-> We have to load driver class provided by database vender inside java class where we are going to perform database actions.

Ways to perform Step-1
----------------------
Way-1:
------
-> Class.forName("fully qualified class name");//Here class is an predefind class (it is available in java.lang package).

=> Class is a pre-defind calss present in 'java.lang' package.
=> forName is a static method present in 'Class class' which accepts one argument in the form of string. 
=> We have to pass fully qualified name of class as argument to the 'forName()' method.
=> forName method will throw a checked exception i.e 'class not found' exception.

Way-2:
------
-> By creating the Driver class Object:
									   Driver d = new Driver();
											^			^
											|			|______________Com.mySql.cj.jdbc.Driver	
									(c) Com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver(c)
													or
									(P) java.sql.Driver(I)

Way-3:
------
DriverManager.registerDriver(newDriver());
